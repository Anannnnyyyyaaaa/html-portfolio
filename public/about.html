<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Air Jordan is a line of basketball shoes produced by Nike, Inc. Related apparel and accessories are marketed under Jordan Brand.

  The first Air Jordan shoe was produced for basketball player Michael Jordan during his time with the Chicago Bulls on November 17, 1984 and released to the public on April 1, 1985.The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As Michael Jordan entered his rookie year in 1984, he was approached to sign a shoe deal with Adidas, Converse, and Nike. In their meeting with Jordan, Nike centered its presentation around a highlight video of Jordan's various slam dunks, scored to "Jump (For My Love)" by the Pointer Sisters. Nike showcased the first design of the shoe, but Jordan criticized its colorway. While other companies saw Jordan as a figure for promoting preexisting shoe lines, Nike took Jordan's criticism into account to make him "a stand alone star and give him a signature shoe line.</p>
<h2>Logo</h2>
<p>The "Jumpman" logo originated from a photo shoot Michael Jordan did for Life magazine before he played for Team USA in the 1984 Summer Olympics, photographed by Jacobus Rentmeester. This photo shoot was taken before Jordan signed with Nike and depicted Jordan posing in a manner identical to the grand jet√© ballet technique, while wearing his Olympic jumpsuit and New Balance basketball shoes.[16] Moore, who was in charge of the design team, came across this Life magazine issue and had Jordan replicate the pose for the pair of Nike shoes. The "Jumpman" logo has developed and gone through different changes and can be seen on sneakers, attire, hats, socks, and other forms of wear. It has become one of the most recognizable logos in the athletics industry.</p>
